This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This app uses [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler) to show how MDX files can be rendered.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/hello.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The `data` directory contains the MD(X) files that gets rendered using mdx-bundler.

The `lib` directory contains the plugins and bundler code.
